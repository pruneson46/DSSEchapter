\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%In the bginning...
Software engineering research aims at developing and validating practically useful methods, technologies and tools to help industry improve software engineering practice. This practical aspect was discussed already when the term `software engineering' was coined in the late 1960's by Margaret Hamilton\footnote{https://publications.computer.org/software-magazine/2018/06/08/margaret-hamilton-software-engineering-pioneer-apollo-11/} and later put in print in a NATO conference report~\cite{Nato1968}. 

\begin{quote}
{The phrase `software engineering'  [implied] the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering} \cite[p. 13]{Nato1968}. 
\end{quote}

Numerous solution proposals to software engineering problems have been invented and published during the past few decades -- these include development methods and processes, tools, frameworks, taxonomies, or languages -- but they are rarely based on systematic investigations of real world problem instances, nor validated in large scale software practice.

%Empirical software engineering
With the advent of empirical software engineering~\cite{Basili86} and evidence-based software engineering~\cite{Kitchenham04}, the research focus shifted towards  empirically-informed understanding of practice and solution proposals. Empirical methods were inherited and adapted from other research fields, particularly medicine and the social sciences, and the knowledge base was built up systematically by families of experiments \cite{Basili99} and systematic literature reviews \cite{Kitchenham15}. However, the methodological advancements were rarely explicitly framed in a research paradigm, and thus it is sometimes unclear what the research contribution is and how to relate to it. 

%Paradigms -> design science
A \emph{research paradigm} refers to ``the combination of types of research questions asked, the research methodologies allowed to answer them and the nature of the pursued research products''~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}. In this chapter we present \per{Which verb should be used to indicate that we do not invent the concepts (propose), but rather elaborate on what others have done?} the \emph{design science paradigm} as a frame for software engineering. The goal is to assist identification of theoretical research contributions and assess these contributions. We propose the design science paradigm as a lens to view \per{Sounds weak? Analyze??} software engineering research, rather than a prescription of methods on how to conduct it. 
Design science is earlier proposed by Wieringa \cite{wieringa_what_2014} for information systems and software engineering, which we merge with perspectives from van Aken \cite{van_aken_management_2004}, from management theory, acknowledging the interdisciplinary characteristic of software engineering \cite{Mendez2019} \emelie{how do we do that?}.

The design science paradigm integrates\emelie{comprises?} \emph{problem conceptualization, solution design} and \emph{validation}. In this chapter, we demonstrate how this paradigm fits as a frame for empirical software engineering with its aim to provide practical solutions\emelie{what about the design propositions? This sentence (and maybe the whole paragraph) put my thoughts on building things rather than building theory} for real-world software engineering challenges. In particular, multiple case studies are proposed as the typical research methodology \emelie{to gain design knowledge?} under the design science paradigm~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}, which aligns with the widespread use of case studies in software engineering. 

% Outline
We provide an overview of the design science paradigm in Section~\ref{sec:overview}, and a more in-depth elaboration of design science concepts in Section~\ref{sec:DesignScienceResearch}. In Section~\ref{sec:UsingDSinSE}, we discuss how  design science can be used to fram software engineering research, and present a visual abstract template to help identifying and assess theoretical contributions in software engineering. Section~\ref{sec:reading} explores some references to work with complementary views on design science, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this chapter.


\section{Design Science -- An Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

%Design science is a paradigm not a method}
There are three major research paradigms, according to van Aken~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{formal sciences} %(e.g.,\ philosophy and mathematics), 
\item \emph{explanatory sciences} %(e.g.,\ natural sciences and most of social sciences), and 
\item \emph{design sciences}% (e.g.,\ engineering sciences and medical sciences).  
\end{itemize}

A research paradigm is a philosophical perspective on the knowledge produced within a research field, using different research methodologies to answer research questions~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}. \per{Comment from reviewer 1 on Kuhn: A  paradigm  also includes the theories underpinning research. }

The \emph{formal sciences} (for example, philosophy and mathematics) focus on building internally consistent systems of knowledge. They are empirically void, as the systems are not related to any empirical observation nor validation. The \emph{explanatory sciences} (for example, the natural sciences and most of the social sciences) aim to describe and explain phenomena that exist, without and before any intervention. \emph{Design sciences} (for example, engineering sciences and medical sciences) aim to understand and improve human-made designs in an area of practice. The borderline between explanatory sciences and design sciences is not always clear, as a research endeavor may contain elements, explaining a naturally occurring phenomenon, for which a proposed intervention later is designed and validated. 

%As a paradigm, 
In this chapter, we view design science as a research paradigm that helps frame research, which aims to improve an area of practice. In our case, the engineering of software is the practice area in focus. The software itself, the tools designed to support the engineers, as well as the organizations developing it, are human-made constructs. This speaks for design science being a feasible research paradigm for software engineering. On the other hand, some of the human behavior of software engineers and their stakeholders are related to humans' intrinsic capabilities and characteristics, which would speak for the explanatory science research paradigm. Still, we argue that most of the studied phenomena in software engineering are designed, and thus the research would benefit from being viewed as design science.

% Design science concepts
The practice is not homogenous over all kinds of software engineering research, neither are the potential improvements the same for all instances of practice. Thus, design science addresses general problems by studying  specific \emph{problem instances}, which constitute the \emph{research contexts}, where the research activities of \emph{problem conceptualization}, \emph{solution design} and \emph{validation} take place. \per{Maybe include graph, as reviewers 1 and 3 propose to? This should then be leading to the model in section 3.}\emelie{It could be a good idea. I tried to figure out what to include in such graph, but it would be very similar to Fig 1, could this (or part of it) be introduced earlier? I provide an example below}



%design propositions
The theoretical contribution of design science research, i.e., the prescriptions for practice, are context dependent. The scientific knowledge, emanating from design science research are prescriptive recommendations, typically captured in \emph{design propositions}\footnote{Van Aken~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}, following Bunge~\cite{bunge_philosophy_1998}, denotes the recommendations as `technological rules'. We choose the term `design propositions' to acknowledge that solutions may be not only technical in software engineering research, but more often socio-technical.}. This means ``field-tested and grounded'' exemplars of how a problem can be solved~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}. The research does not claim that it is an optimal solution, but since it is field tested and grounded, it is a feasible solution.
As a consequence, the validation must be done in context~\cite{wieringa_what_2014}.  This means the  `in vivo' context or the `in vitro' context capture important characteristics of the real context\footnote{`In vivo' (in life) refers to conducting a study in the real context of practice, while `in vitro' (in glass -- the test tube metaphor) refers to en artificial context for the study.}.\emelie{Could other terms (that we don't need to explain) be used?}   





% Methodology aspects
Other than the relation to context, design science does not prescribe specific method steps to be conducted in a research study. The above mentioned research activities (visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:DS_process}) are constituents of  a research process, that may be instantiated in different ways. 
Further, a single study or research paper may or may not contain all the constituents of the design science paradigm; one study may focus, for example,  problem conceptualization towards finding a solution, whereas another may report the complete chain from problem conceptualization to validated solution. Studies that focus on one aspect of design science may contain research contributions that build on, or constitute, the basis for other research under the design science paradigm.

\label{fig:DS_process}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

% Problem conceptualization
Design science research aims to address real practice problems, and thus \emph{problem conceptualization} \per{changed from problem understanding to match terms in fig 1. Ok?} \emelie{In Fig 1, it says problem characterization Should I change that?}is a core constituent of the research. There is a large battery of empirical methods available for problem conceptualization -- surveys, data mining~\cite{MenziesDataMining2016}, ethnography studies \cite{SharpEthnography2016} etc., that can be used for this purpose. 

Problem conceptualization is typically, but not necessarily, the first step in a design science research endeavor. Understanding a general problem, present in one or more concrete problem instances, is a basis for understanding how this general problem may be solved.  While exploring a specific problem instance,  it may become clearer what the core of the problem is, and thus focuses the potential solution design to these areas. 

% Towards solution design
While problem conceptualization is a basis for the research activity, it is not a pure description of the problem. Under the design science paradigm, problems need to be conceptualized in terms of an envisioned solution. Thus, problem conceptualization is often intertwined with the creative activity \emph{solution design} where alternative solutions and previous research are considered. 

% Solution design
%The outcome of a design science research endeavor is ultimately that \emph{design knowledge} is produced, that is, empirically grounded knowledge about how to design solutions to specific problems. The knowledge is gained while solving the identified problem at hand, and abstracted as general knowledge. 

% Validation
 The primary goal of \emph{empirical validation} is to assess whether the solution proposal is feasible for the problem instance. The scope of the design knowledge gained in a study, can be extended by systematically extending the scope of the validation in subsequent studies. Thereby the knowledge base of the research area is extended. The prescriptive knowledge, expressed as design propositions,  may constitute theory fragments that are integrated into more comprehensive theories for software engineering. 


Design science is a paradigm used in many different research fields, and it is instantiated in many different variants.  The above summary reflects what we have found prevalent in software engineering. Some of our rationale and alternative instantiations are discussed below.



\section{A Model of Design Science Research}
\label{sec:DesignScienceResearch}

\label{fig:DS_model}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

% Description of the core of the model
Design science spans two major dimensions, the \emph{problem--solution} dimension and the \emph{theory--practice} dimension. To guide our in-depth elaboration of the design science paradigm, we present a model of design science contributions, see Figure~\ref{fig:DS_model}, where research activities under the design science paradigm can be expressed as transitions across this two-dimensional space.
\per{Make explicit mapping to numbered tags in the model. How to enumerate them?}

% Semantics of the model
The \emph{practical} contribution of the research (i.e., the actual problem solving) is visualized by the boxes in the two bottom quadrants as instances of both the \emph{problem} and the \emph{solution}. The \emph{theoretical} contribution (i.e., generalization and scope definition) is visualized by the boxes in the two top quadrants in terms of the \emph{design proposition(s)} and their \emph{constructs}. 

% Core consituents
The arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:DS_model} illustrate knowledge creating activities that can be performed by both practitioners and researchers. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Problem conceptualization} refers to the activity of describing the problem in terms of the envisioned solution; 
\item \emph{Abstraction} refers to the activity of identifying the key design decisions for a defined scope of validity of a solution; 
\item \emph{Solution design} refers to the activity of mapping a problem to a general solution; 
\item \emph{Instantiation} refers to the activity of implementing the solution in context; and 
\item \emph{Empirical validation} refers to an evaluation of how well the implemented solution addresses the problem.
\end{itemize}

%\per{Mention artifact? See reviewer 2}
Below we explore the contributions and activities of the design science model. \per{Explicit outline?}\emelie{no, I don't think it's needed}

\subsection{Design propositions}
\label{sec:technologicalrules}

\per{I am leaning towards the term Design propositions -- fits well with propositions in general, which are claimed but still not validated as theory.}

% outline: The design proposition is the theoretical contribution of design science research also referred to as design knowledge.
A design proposition captures generalized knowledge about mappings between instances of problems and solutions (i.e., in-context validations) and is thus a means to transfer knowledge between contexts. The design proposition spans both a problem domain and a solution domain, and is formulated based on constructs in both domains. 

%In a design proposition, the solution (or intervention) may, for example,  refer to the use of a specific tool or the application of a more general technology, embedded in a tool. 
The scope of validity of the solution is described in terms of a desired effect in a particular situation.   The design knowledge within the design proposition aims to help software engineering professionals design customized solutions to their specific problems. Ideally it is a general recommendation based on current state of art, including the new additional contribution of a piece of research.

% outline: It can typically be expressed as: 'To achieve <desired effect> in <context> apply <intervention>
Design propositions comprise both the context in terms of the \emph{desired effect} and \emph{the situation}, and a prescription in terms of a \emph{proposed intervention}. Thereby, it frames the research outcome in terms of desired effects and interventions rather than in terms of a solution to a problem. A design proposition can typically be expressed in the form: 

\begin{quote}{\emph{To achieve \textless Effect \textgreater ~ in \textless Situation \textgreater~apply \textless Intervention\textgreater}.} 
%\newline
\end{quote}
\per{ Gregor and Hevner~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013} write "in order to achieve something \emph{similar to} Z in situation Y, then perform X". This gives a better idea of the approximate character if the proposition. What do you think?}\emelie{I think it is too vague, propositions should be falsifiable, and in the long run I guess we expect the propositions to have strong empirical support. I think the term proposition is sufficient to express the approximate character.}
Design propositions correspond to fragments of \emph{design theory} in Gregor and Hevner's work~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013} as well as in Wieringa's, who defines them as theories of artifacts in context~\cite{wieringa_design_2009}.\emelie{We should also mention van Aken's Technological rules here: ... A thorough reflection about the role, nature and need for design propositions (aka technological rules) in design science research is provided by van Aken\cite{van_aken_management_2004}}.

% Generalization 
In a design proposition, a class of software engineering problems are generalized to a stakeholder's desired effect of applying a potential intervention in a specified situation. 
Making this problem generalization explicit helps the researcher identify and communicate the different value-creating aspects of a research study or program.

% outline: The abstraction level may vary
Wieringa and Daneva address generalizability of design theory~\cite{wieringa_six_2015} and argue that there is no such thing as general design theories. Instead they emphasize the utility of \emph{middle-ranged theory}, defined as theories lacking universal scope. \emelie{I'm not sure I agree that the design propositions lack universal scope. They are general predictions. It may be that there may be unknown factors proving our predictions wrong but the predictions are still universal aren't they? Saying that something lacks universal scope is to say that generalization is not possible and then research is pointless or what can we learn from research if nothing is generalizeable? I suggest that we ignore their discussion.}
Design propositions are examples of such middle-ranged theories \per{fragments?} that can be expressed at any convenient abstraction level. However, design propositions expressed at a very high abstraction level (e.g., ``To produce software of high quality apply good software engineering practices'') tend to be either trivial or too bold (easy to debunk), while propositions at very low abstraction levels have a narrow scope and thus lack relevance for most software engineers. 

%Examples of DS in SE
How the intervention in a design proposition is formulated may vary. It could, for example, refer to the use of a tool or articulate abstractions of the knowledge embedded in the tool. It could also refer to the application of a practice, a technique, a framework, or a set of guidelines. We extracted 38 examples of design propositions from a set of distinguished ICSE-papers from 2014--2018~\cite{Engstrom19arxiv}, these propositions demonstrate the breadth of knowledge that can be represented using design propositions. These design propositions are available online at \url{http://dsse.org}.

% Hierarichical design propositions
One single instance of a problem-solution pair can generate multiple design propositions that are hierarchically related to each other. For example, an abstract proposition may recommend using a general type of technology, while several more detailed propositions may specify the use of technology, embedded in a specific tool.  Similarly, there are hierarchical relationships with prior related design propositions to which a specific contribution is compared.
\peggy{it may be nice to show an example of this hierarchical relationship at work -- I may have something we can use for this for the next version -- still trying to work it out}
Thus, it is important to explicitly formulate the design proposition when presenting design science research and to be consistent with it both when arguing for its relevance and its novelty, as well as when presenting the empirical (or analytical) support for the claims.  A research contribution may refine any of the three constituents of an existing proposition, add empirical support for the proposition as a whole, or present a new proposition.

\per{Mention artifacts?}



\subsection{Problem and design constructs}
\label{sec:constructs}
% Constructs as theoretical design knowledge
Another type of theoretical knowledge, produced in design science, is the 
constructs on which we build design propositions. That is, the conceptualization of the problem domain and the solution domain, respectively.  
A construct can, for example, be a taxonomy that is used to articulate a design proposition or to classify a set of design propositions in a research review. 
Taxonomies provide the means to relate different design propositions to each other. The different constituents of a design proposition may belong to different taxonomies. A construct can also be a conceptual model or a conceptualization approach that helps describe a problem in terms of an envisioned solution.

Design knowledge is gained by investigating one or more instances of a solution in context~\cite{wieringa_what_2014}. Each instantiation (for example, a case study or an iteration of action research) constitutes a unit of analysis in relation to the design proposition and the new knowledge is communicated and assessed from that perspective.\emelie{Should this paragraph belong to Sec 3.1?} 

\subsection{Problem conceptualization and solution design}
 % Who, What, Where, When, Why and How

% (Who?) Problem understanding is ultimately an act of the practitioner but could be done in collaboration between researchers and practitioners or by researchers alone

\per{I made an attempt to rephrase, please check.}
In a mature research field, existing theory may help practitioners design solutions to their own specific problems. Problem conceptualization is then an act of the practitioner, as well as the instantiation of the solution in a specific context. In fields where the theoretical foundation is less mature, such as software engineering, researchers and practitioners work together to advance and extend the scope of the theory. \emelie{I think it is ok, but wonder if we are aware of such mature field :-). I guess researchers may be part of advancing any field of research}
%In the long run, software engineering theory aims at helping practitioners design solutions to their specific problems. Thus problem understanding is ideally an act of a software engineering practitioner and not a researcher.
%\peggy{"ideally" do you mean "often"?}
 %However, to produce a more general theory, research is needed. 
% \peggy{only researchers can produce theory? not sure I agree :) } \per{Lets' sort this out in the next revision. I think it is an attempt to express the focus on context}

 In the previous section, we describe how design knowledge is obtained and matures through observations of real life instances of problem-solution pairs. For each such instance, the problem needs to be formulated (understood) according to a conceptual lens. Such problem conceptualization can take place in collaboration between practitioners and researchers in, for example, action research or case study research, or by researchers observing software engineering practice.

% (What?) The outcome of the problem understanding step is a conceptualuzation of the problem instance towards an envisioned solution and thus tightly connected to a specific design approach

The outcome of the problem conceptualization is expressed in terms of problem elements/constructs, matching coresponding constructs of an envisioned solution. \per{Was: "The outcome of the problem understanding activities is a conceptualization of the problem instance towards an envisioned solution." Ok?}\emelie{changed to: matching, ok?} If, for example, the proposed solution is to design a visualization system, the problem should typically be described in terms of a group of target users, their questions and tasks, and their measurements or data~\cite{meyer_nested_2015}. Thus, the problem formulation is tightly connected to the solution design and cannot be done in isolation. 

Problem conceptualization is to a large extent in the eye of the beholder. A behavioural scientist would, for example,  make a different problem conceptualization of a software project, compared to a software engineering researcher. While different software engineering researchers may be influenced by their background, emphasizing how problem conceptualization is intertwined with solution design.\emelie{cut this paragraph out?}

% (What?) The research contribution is not the conceptualization, but the identification of the problem instance (empirical support for prevalence of a conceptual problem) and potential updates of the modelling approach (new aspects of the technological rule)

Furthermore, the research contribution is \emph{not} the conceptualization as such, since this is connected to the instance of the problem and not the class of problems. Instead the research contribution is the empirical support for new, existing or refined design propositions. A research contribution from the problem conceptualization step could, for example, be the identification of problem instances -- confirming the prevalence of a general problem -- or updates of the conceptualization approach -- i.e., the design constructs of a general solution.

\peggy{I'm feeling this is a bit long winded but I'm too close to it to suggest what to cut or how to condense -- the other reviewers may help in this regard.  We say "for example" a lot...} \per{Yes, for next round...}

% (When?) Problem understanding is the first step towards a solution design.

%Problem conceptualization is the first step towards a solution design. 
Depending on the type of solution, problem conceptualization may need to be repeated at several abstraction levels starting with the stakeholder's problem description and, in case of a tool reaching to the level of implementation details (such as  choice of algorithm). If this is the case, different types of design propositions are used and validated at different abstraction levels. It is important to be aware of what these propositions are and to ensure that the validation of a solution takes place at all these levels and that the validations are mapped to the correct design propositions. \emelie{exemplify or refer to the nested model?} 

% (Where?) Problem understanding must originate in empirical observations of practice
Software engineering is a discipline, in which conditions are changing rapidly. To provide relevant recommendations -- design propositions --  the problem conceptualization must originate in empirical observations of practice and within real life problem instances. Furthermore, software engineering is a socio-technical endeavour implying that stakeholders should often be involved in both problem conceptualization and solution validation, at least for design propositions at the higher abstraction levels. Lower level design propositions may be investigated in isolation to stakeholders but must be related to the higher level propositions to be relevant.\emelie{cut this paragraph out?} 
\peggy{I think it depends on what the rule is aimed at too -- if it is something that is fully automated perhaps stakeholders are not needed} \per{I think there are stakeholders also in automated cases, e.g. reducing compile/build/test time may be addressed with a fully automated solution, but there is a stakeholder developer who would benefit from shorter turn around time.}
% (How?) Problem understanding should build on prior work
In a mature design science field, problem conceptualization can be guided by theory, i.e., prior design propositions and conceptualization approaches. 


%Creative process/alternative solutions should be considered/design decisions reported
One activity in the production of design knowledge is to work through iterations of a solution design, either together with practitioners in a real-life setting or off-line. 
While solution design is a creative activity, the design knowledge it produces can be made more accessible and trustworthy if critical design decisions are clearly reported together with considerations about alternative solutions.

%May include several levels of design/evaluation and validation 


%Reflections on the design process less important in the SE domain than in the IS domain
Wieringa describes design science as an act of producing knowledge by designing useful things~\cite{wieringa_design_2009} and makes a distinction between \emph{knowledge} problems and \emph{practical} problems. Similarly, Gregor and Hevner emphasize the dual focus on the artifact and its design in information systems~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}, and argue for an iterative design process where validation of the artifact provides feedback  to improve both the design process and the artifact. Although such an approach may be relevant for designing software engineering artifacts too, there is an important difference between the two research domains: while information systems refers to a solution domain, software engineering research originates in a problem domain with a plethora of more or less sophisticated solutions, not necessarily artifacts. Thus, the empirical contribution to problem conceputalization is of higher importance in the software engineering context, while the reflection on the design as such is of less value compared to research contributions in a typical solution domain such as information systems. Still, in both cases it is design knowledge that is produced as the aim is to produce prescriptive knowledge for practitioners in their respective domain. 

 

\subsection{Validation, instantiation and abstraction}

To validate a design proposition it must be instantiated, preferably in multiple cases of problem solution-pairs that instantiate the proposition. Each case adds to the validity strength of the proposition. Alternatively,  a new design proposition may be abstracted from an observed implemented solution to a real life problem.

Validation of research under the design science paradigm is always about a problem--solution pair in \emph{context}. The constituents of the design proposition implicitly specify the validation activities, if expressed in the form of:

\begin{quote}{\emph{To achieve \textless Effect \textgreater ~ in \textless Situation \textgreater~apply \textless Intervention\textgreater}.} 
\end{quote} 
The \emph{intervention} is the object of study, the \emph{situation} defines the context, and the expected \emph{effect} defines the validation criteria. This points to `in vivo' software engineering context as the ultimate validation context for design science research. Multiple case studies are consequently brought forward as the natural research methodology in design science \cite{van_aken_management_2004}. However, for some design problems, the characteristics of the real context may be very similar to the `in vitro' settings for the validation. For example, a tool which has no human--tool interaction can be evaluated with real or realistic data in an off-line setting. In other cases, practical economical limitations can prevent the research endeavour from taking place in real, operational environments, and thus scaled down validation contexts may be used in the research. 

The risks related to validating interventions in business critical contexts may be high. If the intervention does not deliver the effect as expected, the outcome of the software engineering activity as a whole may be endangered. Further, the costs related to implementing the intervention may also be high -- for example changing a work flow or adapting the information infrastructure to a new tool. Thus, validation procedures may be used, which gradually extend the validation scope for the intervention.

On the other hand, reducing the scope and complexity of the validation context by too much may reduce the realism which is essential for addressing a relevant problem with a feasible solution. `In vitro' studies may be useful to validate specific mechanisms, but they are not feasible for complex systems studies.  

Stol and Fitzgerald adapted Runkel and McGrath's framework for research strategies, to guide balancing generalizability, precision and realism in designing validation studies \cite{StolABC18}\per{chapter X in this book?}. This framework may be useful in choosing research strategies in relation to the goals of the research endeavour. The framework defines two dimensions: i) universality/specificity of context and systems, and ii) level of obtrusiveness. Maximum potential realism is achieved with specific contexts and systems, and more or less obtrusive research, depending on the perspective of explanatory research (field study) or design science (field experiments).  

The specific choice of methods for the validation depends on the research question. Easterbrook \emph{et al.} provide guidance to the selection of methods and conclude for the philosophical stance behind design science: ``Pragmatists use any available methods, and strongly prefer mixed methods research, where several methods are used to shed light on the issue under study''~\cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}. 
This recommendation fits well with the design science paradigm and its pragmatist viewpoint.

\end{figure} 

Furthermore, the choice of method depends on the abstraction level of the validation. Munzner illustrate this in a nested model for visualization design and validation, see Figure~\ref{fig:nested_model}. This model illustrates how one design science project must respond to validity questions at several levels of abstraction, and that it is important to be consistent when selecting validation methods to avoid a mismatch between levels. \per{Expand the explanation}\emelie{I made an attempt in the caption} As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:technologicalrules}, design propositions may be defined at all these different levels and the scope of validity of each proposition is defined by the context in terms of the conceptualization of the problem at the current abstraction level.

The design science paradigm builds primarily on theoretical/analytical generalizations, in contrast to explanatory sciences, which mostly rely on statistical generalizations~\cite[p. 30]{Runeson12Case}. Extending the scope of validity for a design proposition, i.e., creating a new more general proposition, is done by applying the intervention to new contexts or by reasoning about the validity to another context, by comparing key characteristics of the contexts. This is referred to as case-based generalization~\cite{wieringa_six_2015}.  

Design propositions may also develop from the general to the specific. The research may start with a general proposition which is refined as new knowledge is gained through the instantiation of the proposition in multiple contexts. 


\subsection{Research Methods in Design Science} 
\per{I removed the Gorschek figure -- can we keep the text?}\emelie{ok}

Design science may embrace a multitude of research methods to be used. For \emph{problem conceptualization} and \emph{validation} of design propositions, empirical research methods are used. Methods supporting natural settings are preferred as the problem in context is in focus for design science research. 
%\peggy{but Stol/Fitzgerald somehow treat system and human actors as the same in terms of method selection which to me goes against the goal of knowing when stakeholders should be involved or not but this is a discussion for a different day :) }

Design science is considered a methodology by other scholars in software engineering~\cite{Wohlin2015}. As a consequence, they focus on the %valid research 
activities (how to conduct the research) rather than on the theoretical contributions of the research (how to theorize from the research), which is the case when it is considered a paradigm. However, %since a paradigm includes the methodologies, as defined above, 
there is a strong connection between the paradigm and the methodologies used.%, although the mapping is not one-to-one.


The typical research methodology used to study and test design propositions is multiple case studies. In multiple case studies, a series of problems of the same class are addressed. Design knowledge is built up through the empirical validations of the solution in context. 
In a survey of 101 industry-academia collaboration projects, Garousi \emph{et al.} found 75 that were characterized as case studies~\cite{Garousi2019}. Further, they note that ``industrial case studies usually apply either the `exploratory' or the `improving' type, or both, rather than other case study types (descriptive, explanatory)''. Methods for data collection and analysis can be selected from the rich plethora of options available for such studies, for example, interviews, focus groups, observational studies, archival data analysis, and software metric analysis. 


Action research is another way of producing and validating design propositions.  41 of the 101 industry-academia collaboration projects surveyed by Garousi \emph{et al.} were labeled as action research \cite{Garousi2019}. However action research does not explicitly aim at developing knowledge that can be transferred to other contexts, but rather to make a change in one specific local context. However, both Wieringa~\cite{wieringa_technical_2012} and Johannesson and Perjons~\cite{johannesson_introduction_2014} discuss action research as one of several empirical methods that can be used to produce design knowledge.


Gorschek \emph{et al.} defined a ``model for technology transfer in practice'' \cite{GorschekSW2006} focusing on industry--academia collaboration, which has some elements of design science. The model, which prescribes conceptual steps in solving a problem in an industry-academia collaboration setting, has elements of problem identification and formulation. The design of solutions involve studying the literature (state of the art) and selection of a candidate solution. This solution is validated in three steps, in academia, statically, and dynamically, before it is released into operations. 

These elements fit the design science lens, although the model (by intention) focuses primarily on the artifact and specific context, rather than the generalized knowledge and design proposition, which are significant element of design science research. Further, when the generalization of knowledge and iterative knowledge building is stressed, it becomes clear that industry--academia collaboration is not a one-way transfer of technology, but a mutual interaction between the two.


\section{Using the Design Science Frame in Software Engineering}
\label{sec:UsingDSinSE}

%Software engineering research aims at improving practice, which implies needs for various kinds of collaboration between researchers and practitioners. 
In their practitioner article on industry--academia collaboration in software engineering, Carver and Prikladnicki stress the importance of a synergistic relationship between software practitioners and software engineering researchers:
\begin{quote}Practitioners could obtain more relevant research results, and researchers could better understand the type and scope of problems to examine.~\cite{CarverIEEESW2018}
\end{quote} 

These practitioner--researcher synergies resonate well with the design science paradigm.  We designed a \emph{visual abstract template} as a tool to analyze design science constructs in software engineering research  (Section~\ref{sec:VA_template})~\cite{StoreyESEM17}. We suggest three direct uses of the design science paradigm as a frame for software engineering research, which we illustrate through an example (Section~\ref{sec:examples}). First, it can help in assessing contributions in research, both for the research community and during the planning and design of a research project (Section~\ref{sec:assessment}). Second, design science, particularly the design proposition, can be used in knowledge building, synthesizing and advancing the theoretical knowledge in the software engineering field (Section~\ref{sec:knowledge}). Third, the design science frame may help in communicating research across the research community and with industry (Section~\ref{sec:communication}). 


\subsection{A template to highlight design science constructs}% in software engineering}
\label{sec:VA_template}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, trim={0 15mm 0 0},clip]{Figures/GenericVA.png}
\caption{Visual abstract template including the core constructs in the design science paradigm.}
\label{fig:VA-template}      
\end{figure}


%Design Science as a Lens
The design science perspective is rarely used explicitly to design and present software engineering research~\cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. We therefore designed a \emph{visual abstract template} to help identify the design science constructs in software engineering research~\cite{StoreyESEM17}, see Figure~\ref{fig:VA-template}\per{Update terminology if we stick to design proposition}. We further extended the template with survey questions, to help analyze software engineering literature from a design science perspective~\cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. The template aims to capture the key takeaway from a research study to help researchers assess the research contribution, build knowledge iteratively, and communicate research to practitioners. %Note connections to end of this chapter

Our design science template covers the main constructs of design science research: the theoretical contribution in terms of a \emph{design proposition}; its instantiation in terms of a real \emph{problem--solution} pair;  the empirical or theoretical support for \emph{problem} conceptualization, and the \emph{solution} design. Further, the bottom three boxes address the \emph{relevance} of the research, the \emph{rigor} of the research activities,  and a statement about what makes the design proposition \emph{novel} in relation to the underpinning research, be it with focus on a refined problem conceptualization, or a new or improved solution design, or a validation of the the design proposition in a new context. 



\subsection{Design Science Example}
\label{sec:examples}
To illustrate the use of the design science lens for software engineering research, we present and discuss an example by Jonsson \emph{et al.}, introducing automated bug assignment to handle a large inflow of bug reports \cite{JonssonBug15}. We have used the same example to illustrate our visual abstract \cite{StoreyESEM17}, see Figure \ref{fig:BugAssignment}.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, trim={5mm 20mm 5mm 20mm },clip]{Figures/VATemplateJonsson.pdf}
\caption{Visual abstract for the paper on automated bug assignment \cite{JonssonBug15}.}
\label{fig:BugAssignment}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The automated bug assignment research was not originally presented through the design science lens. However, like much software engineering research, it is implicitly conducted as design science research \cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. 
The scientific knowledge gained from the work can be phrased as a \emph{design proposition}:
\begin{quote}{To achieve more effective assignment of bugs to teams in large scale industrial contexts use ensemble-based machine learning to automate bug assignment. \cite{StoreyESEM17}}\end{quote}

The general \emph{problem} of inefficient bug assignment is observed in the literature as well as in the specific industrial contexts, where this research was conducted. With the solution in mind to use machine learning techniques to assign bugs to teams, the characteristics of the defect data and the organizational context were explored. We thus identified the characteristics of the \emph{problem instance}. Related work on bug classification, as well as on machine learning techniques was identified \cite{Borg2013EMSE}, and underpinned the \emph{design decisions} for the proposed solution. The machine learning solutions were implemented  and trained using the Weka framework \cite{hall_weka_2009}. Several alternative solution instances were \emph{validated} on real data from five projects across two companies/domains, on 50,000 bug reports. For the specific companies, a design artifact was produced, namely the bug assignment tool built on top of Weka.

The \emph{relevance} of the research is ensured by anchoring the research in the literature as well as in the specific problem instances of the study. Research \emph{rigor} is ensured by structured and transparent research methods, conducted with real world data. The \emph{novelty} of the research lies in the design proposition, embedding the choice of machine learning classifiers (ensemble-based), validating the ability to demonstrate a system of automated bug assignment where precision is on par with the existing manual procedures.

%Our example study of automated bug assignment was conducted in several steps, which can be described in terms of the technology transfer model in Figure \ref{fig:GorschekModel}: \per{Remove this as a consequence of removing the figure in 3.5?}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{Problem/issue}: Overall problem phrased as manual assignment of bugs to teams being costly and error prone
%\item \emph{Problem formulation}: In-depth studies of defect reports and their links to other information elements and activities helped characterize the problem
%\item \emph{Study state of the art}: A systematic mapping study was performed of trace-link research, identifying the theoretical foundations \cite{Borg2013EMSE}
%\item \emph{Candidate solution}: Development of experimental tools, supporting multiple algorithms
%\item \emph{Validation in academia}: Comparison of algorithm performance in academic research \cite{BorgESEM13}
%\item \emph{Dynamic validation}: Training and cross-validation of tool on real data sets \cite{JonssonBug15}
%\item \emph{Release solution}: Incorporation of a simplified version of the tools into the company's toolset
%\end{itemize} 
%
%In this case, we performed no static validation as we had the opportunity to make a dynamic off-line validation with real industry data. We use the example below when discussing the use of the design science as a frame to assess research contributions, build knowledge, and communicate research.

\subsection{Assessment of contributions}
\label{sec:assessment}

Hevner presents three research cycles in  the conceptual model of design science, namely the \emph{relevance},   the \emph{rigor} and the \emph{design} cycles \cite{Hevner2007}. We propose that the contributions of design science research be assessed accordingly, with respect to \emph{relevance, rigor} and \emph{novelty}. 
Assessment of research contributions can be conducted proactively (when relevance may be a primary concern for consideration and before the research is executed), prospectively (as the research is ongoing and when rigor should be carefully considered), or retrospectively (where novelty of the design knowledge produced may become more evident).
Below, we discuss assessments of contributions and refer to the examples we described above.



% Peggy:  not sure what to do with this...
%\paragraph{Validation should be made in context and test the impact of the solution on the real problem}

\subsubsection{Relevance} 

Relevance of a design science study is described in terms of problem similarity and solution applicability. The relevance of a research contribution could be viewed from two perspectives: 1) from other practitioners that may benefit from the design knowledge produced, and 2) from the research community. 

From an individual practitioner's point of view, the relevance of a research contribution may be assessed by comparing their specific context with the study context described in the research report. 
A practitioner may need to consider how their specific context may allow the design knowledge to be applied as is, or if it should be customized in some way, or perhaps the knowledge may not apply at all to their situation or problem.
In the example by Jonsson \emph{et al.}, (see Figure \ref{fig:BugAssignment}) a practitioner may  similarly face the challenge of manually assigning bugs to teams and  that they too could benefit from using ensemble-based machine learning to automate the bug assignment (or not).

From the research community perspective, relevance is often considered in terms of how common the studied problem is, and how generalizable the produced design knowledge may be. To enable both types of assessments, relevant context factors need to be reported. Not all context factors are helpful in making this assessment, but only those that are critical for either the applicability of the solution or for the potential gain of applying the solution. 
Referring to the example by Jonsson \emph{et al.}, applying machine learning to bug assignment is  a frequent topic of research in software engineering. These authors report 20 previous studies on machine learning-based bug assignment \cite[Fig.2]{JonssonBug15}, which adds evidence that this problem is relevant in practice.

\subsubsection{Rigor} 
Rigor of a design science study refers to the strength of the added support for the design proposition. It may be assessed in all of the three knowledge creating activities (problem conceptualization, design, and solution validation). 
Rigor should be considered when the research project is designed, as well as throughout the project and afterwards to reflect on possible threats to validity. 

It is worth noting that the solution design activity is by nature a creative process and does not necessarily have to add to the rigor of the research overall. One aspect of rigor in the design activity could be the extent to which a solution is built on prior design knowledge, and in such cases consideration of alternative solutions can be taken into account. 
In the case by Jonsson \emph{et al.}, they choose alternative classifiers from the Weka tool by reasoning about their properties, and combined them into ensembles of classifiers for evaluation.

The other two activities, i.e., problem conceptualization and solution validation, are on the other hand based on common empirical methods on which relevant validity criteria can be applied. For example, the study by Jonsson \emph{et al.} can be considered high in rigor as the proposed solution is validated by its application to 5 defect datasets from two large software systems, comprising 50,000 bugs.  Furthermore, they found that the precision in the automated bug assignment was on par with the manual industry practice, which makes it useful in practice.

\subsubsection{Novelty } 
Novelty of a design science study is expressed in terms of new or refined design propositions. Design propositions may be expressed at several abstraction levels, thus it is always possible to identify an abstraction level at which a research contribution is novel, may it be at the cost of general relevance.  In the research by Jonsson \emph{et al.}, novelty of the intervention proposed in the design proposition is not straightforward to assess, as there already exists 20 studies on machine learning to automate bug assignment. The novel contribution here is the systematic design and evaluation of a machine learning approach, applied to a real-world context, as expressed in the design proposition.

However, novelty may not always be a priority in a given research effort.
To optimize rigor, novelty and relevance of reported research, the researchers should strive to express the design proposition at the highest possible abstraction level at which it is novel, the provided evidence gives strong support, and the proposition is not debunked by previous studies (or commonsense). However, adding empirical support for existing, but under-validated, design propositions have a value of its own, which makes novelty less important than the rigor and relevance criteria.


\subsection{Knowledge building}
\label{sec:knowledge}

Articulating the knowledge that is produced by our research in a more uniform way may help in building and synthesizing related knowledge in our community. 
The design propositions that emerge can at best be considered as theory fragments that prescribe and predict how a certain intervention for a particular context will lead to a proposed change. 
Our hope is that linking design propositions that are related (perhaps in hierarchical form) may over time help our community arrive at theories that may be more general, and that can be refined and improved over time. 

For example, Jonsson \emph{et al.}'s research on automated bug assignment is related to previous bug assignment research, although it is hard to compare due to lack of detail and non-standardized validation practice. If the contributions were clearly expressed as design propositions with corresponding validations, the outcomes together would be more generalizable. 
\peggy{not sure I agree the same validations are needed?}

\subsection{Research communication}
\label{sec:communication}

As we discussed above, building design knowledge in software engineering requires a close partnership and tight collaborations with practitioners. 
Practitioners play a participatory role in our research by confirming and eliciting problems to be solved, as well as by designing practical solutions using design knowledge, and then validating them in context (on real problem instances). 
Consequently, how we communicate our research to practitioners is critical to this participatory research approach. 

We feel the design propositions will be valuable in communicating our findings to industry and that the visual abstract may also appeal to some practitioners wanting to quickly gain a bigger picture of the research that is behind the design knowledge embodied by the design proposition. 
At the time of writing this chapter, we are in the process of evaluating our visual abstracts

Other examples include Petersen and Engstr\"om's framework, SERP taxonomy architecture~\cite{petersen_finding_2014} including the constructs of a design proposition  
(i.e., desired effect, context and intervention), to support the mapping of practical problems with research. 
This framework provides a taxonomy that establishes a common understanding between practitioners and researchers in software testing~\cite{engstrom_SERP-test_2017} and may support practitioners to review regression testing literature from a relevance point of view~\cite{ali_search_2019}, leading to generalized recommendations in terms of design propositions. 

Another attempt to make evidence available to practitioners is presented by Cartaxo et al. \cite{Cartaxo2016}. 
They present the concept of ``evidence briefings'', which is a way to summarize Systematic Literature Reviews in a one-page format. 
They used accepted information design principles to design the structure of the one-page briefing. The format and content were positively validated by both practitioners and researchers. While evidence briefings may provide an effective way to synthesize evidence from several studies, our visual abstract template provides a means to effectively summarize the contribution of one study or research program from a design science perspective.

\peggy{we really do need to validate the communication to industry part !}



\section{Recommended Further Reading}
\label{sec:reading}
Several fields of research have explicitly framed their work under the design science paradigm. This chapter is based on critically appraising these fields and adopting what we have found feasible for software engineering. We present the main literature sources and recommend them for further reading to advance software engineering under the design science paradigm.

Hevner has conceptualized design science for \emph{information systems research}, combining behavioral science and design science research \cite{hevner_design_2004,hevner_design_2010}.
The philosophical stance behind design science is what is characterized as pragmatism~\cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}, referring to a view that all knowledge is approximate and valued by its usefulness for solving practical problems. Hevner \emph{et al.} express this in terms of \emph{utility}: 

\begin{quote}
	That is the essence of design science. Contribution arises from utility. If the artifact does not solve the problem (search, implementability), it has no utility. If utility is not demonstrated (evaluation), then there is no basis upon which to accept the claims that it provides any contribution (contribution).~\cite[p. 91]{hevner_design_2004}
\end{quote}


Gregor and Hevner also refer to design science as a paradigm~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}. Johannesson and Perjons, on the other hand, disagree with this and argue that design science refers to the objective of changing the world, in contrast to describing it, and that this is done primarily by creating artifacts, not knowledge~\cite{johannesson_introduction_2014}. Johannesson and Perjons' view emphasizes design science as action research. Our stance is that design science is a paradigm for software engineering research and as researchers, our primary goal is to create knowledge to be applied by practitioners in the field. Furthermore, we consider artifacts as embedding design knowledge. 

Hevner adds three research cycles to the conceptual model of design science, namely the \emph{relevance}, the \emph{design} and the \emph{rigor} cycles \cite{Hevner2007}. The relevance cycle connects the environment with the design science activities, the design  cycle iterates between designing and evaluating the interventions, while the rigor cycle connects the research with the theoretical foundation of the research.



Van Aken explored the design science paradigm for management science, with a focus on theoretical contributions, captured as design propositions \cite{van_aken_management_2004,van_aken_management_2005}. 
In the field of research with organizations as their study objects, van Aken proposed to make a distinction between explanatory and design sciences by dividing the research into two fields: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Organization Theory as description-driven research under the explanatory research paradigm, observing how organizations behave `naturally', and 
\item Management Theory as prescription-driven research under the design sciences paradigm, designing interventions to manage organization~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}.  
\end{itemize}

We do not propose a corresponding distinction for software engineering, but call researchers to have awareness of the existence of the different paradigmatic perspectives, and their implications for choice of research methodology and knowledge building.

The Nobel Prize laureate in Economics, Herbert A.\ Simon, used other terms for the distinction between explanatory and design sciences paradigms~\cite{Simons69}. Design sciences are referred to as the ``science of the artificial'', in contrast to explanatory science, as the ``science of the natural''. The latter refers not only to natural sciences in the narrow sense, but to other phenomena that seem to appear `naturally'. In this broader sense, we may find both `natural' and `artificial' phenomena in software engineering, and thus may frame the research in different paradigms, depending on the phenomenon under study. 


Wierenga instantiated design science for software engineering and information systems research in the concept of technical action research, including an engineering cycle and an empirical research cycle, which combines research with real-world consultancy projects \cite{wieringa_six_2015,wieringa_technical_2012,wieringa_what_2014}. Further, to address the distinction between the descriptive and the prescriptive research, he introduces two types of research questions, namely \emph{knowledge} questions and \emph{improvement} questions \cite{wieringa_design_2009}. He also discusses scaling up research to practice \cite{Wieringa2014}. 

Munzner reviewed design science research in the field of visualization design and introduced a four-level nested model of design and validation, see Figure~\ref{fig:nested_model}~\cite{munzner2009}. She divides the design process into four distinct stages and emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between these levels when claiming contributions at more than one level. The nested model is a good example of a design construct in the solution domain, i.e., visualization, providing a lens for the problem conceptualization. Although, not all software engineering problems are solved with visualization approaches, the model may inspire similar thinking in other design processes. 


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The design science paradigm is used in many fields of research, which aim to understand and improve some area of practice. Software engineering researchers have not used the design science to frame their research explicitly, although we found in an analysis that it resonates well with the aims and research practice in software engineering~\cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. 

There are many flavours of design science in related fields of research. In this chapter, we propose an instantiation of design science that we find suitable for the characteristics of software engineering research. We also present our visual abstract, derived to help assess and communicate design science research~\cite{StoreyESEM17}. 

We hope that the community will adopt the design science frame for software engineering research, to provide better tools for researchers to define and assess relevance, rigor and novelty of research, to assist communication between researchers and with practitioners, and to support continuous theoretical knowledge building in software engineering.
