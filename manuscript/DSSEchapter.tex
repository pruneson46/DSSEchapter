\abstract{Software engineering research aims to contribute to improved real-world practice. With the adoption of empirical software engineering research methods, the understanding of real-world needs and validation of proposals have evolved, while a systematic approach to design or improvement is less advanced in the community.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Software engineering research aims at developing and validating practically useful methods, technologies and tools to help industry to improve software engineering practice. This practical aspect was discussed already when the term `software engineering' was coined in the late 1960's by Margaret Hamilton\footnote{https://publications.computer.org/software-magazine/2018/06/08/margaret-hamilton-software-engineering-pioneer-apollo-11/} and later put in print in a NATO conference report~\cite{Nato1968}. 

\begin{quote}
{The phrase 'software engineering' was [...] implying the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering} \cite[p13]{Nato1968}. 
\end{quote}

Lots of solution proposals to software engineering problems have been invented and published during the decades -- be it development methods and processes, tools, frameworks, taxonomies, or languages -- but they are rarely systematically based on problem instances, nor validated in large scale software practice.

With the advent of empirical~\cite{Basili86} and evidence-based software engineering~\cite{Kitchenham04}, the research focus shifted towards validation of solution proposals. Empirical methods were inherited and adapted from various research fields, particularly medicine and social sciences, and the knowledge basis was build up systematically by families of experiments \cite{Basili99} and systematic literature reviews \cite{Kitchenham15}. \per{New text: However, the methodological advancements are rarely set into an explicit research paradigm frame, and thus it is sometime unclear what the research contribution is and how to relate to it.} %However, in contrast to the significant methodological advancement of the validation side, the design of interventions or solutions to address the software engineering problems are not given the same attention. \emelie{I don't think DS will change that as its focus is on articulating technological rules and their empirical support (validation). There is not much practical guidance on how to do regarding any of the three activities: problem understanding, solution design and validation.}

In this chapter, we introduce the \emph{design science paradigm} as a frame for software engineering. The design science paradigm integrates \emph{problem understanding, solution design} and \emph{validation}, and this fits well as a frame for empirical software engineering and its aim to provide practical solutions for real-world software engineering challenges. Particularly, multiple case studies are proposed as the typical research method in design science \cite{van_aken_management_2004}, which fits with the widespread use of case studies in software engineering.

We provide an overview of the design science paradigm in Section \ref{sec:overview} TBD outline

\section{Design Science -- An Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
%Design science is a paradigm not a method}

\subsection{Design Science as a Paradigm}

There are three major research paradigms, according to van Aken~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}, meaning ``the combination of research questions asked, the research methodologies allowed to answer them and the nature of the pursued research products'':
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{formal sciences} (e.g.\ philosophy and mathematics), 
\item \emph{explanatory sciences} (e.g.\ natural sciences and most of social sciences), and 
\item \emph{design sciences} (e.g.\ engineering sciences and medical sciences).  
\end{itemize}

We consider design science as a \emph{paradigm}, that helps framing research, aiming towards improving an area of practice. In our case, the engineering of software is the practice area in focus. The practice is not homogenous over all kinds of software engineering, neither are the potential improvements the same for all instances of practice. Thus, design science addresses a general problem by studying  specific \emph{problem instances}, which constitute the \emph{research contexts}.  There the research activities of \emph{problem understanding}, \emph{solution design} and \emph{validation} take place. \per{Mention Wieringa's cycles?}

Design science does not prescribe a specific methodology nor specific method steps to be conducted in a single research study. The above mentioned activities are constituents of  a research process, that may be instantiated in different ways. Different methodologies -- empirical, analytical, and  design methodologies -- may be used within the frame of design science. Further, a single study or research paper may or may not contain all the constituents of the design science paradigm; one study may be focused on, for example,  problem understanding towards finding a solution, another may report the complete chain from problem understanding to validated solution. Studies focusing on one aspect of design science may contain research contributions that build on, or constitute, the basis for other research under the design science paradigm.

%Technological rules
The scientific knowledge, emanating from design science research, is typically captured in \emph{technological rules}. This means ``field-tested and grounded'' exemplars \per{use the word or not?} of how a problem can be solved~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}.
%Technological rules may be defined at different levels of abstraction. Very high level rules, of the type:
%\begin{quote}{To produce software of high quality apply good software engineering practices}\end{quote} are either trivial or too bold. On the other hand, too detailed rules, highly specialized for the specific problem instance under study is not possible to generalize.

% Problem understanding
Design science research aims to address real practice problems, and thus \emph{problem understanding} is a core constituent of the research. There is a large battery of empirical methods available for problem understanding -- case studies \cite{Runeson12Case}, surveys, data mining \cite{MenziesDataMining2016}, ethnography studies \cite{SharpEthnography2016}, etc. -- that can be used for the purpose. 

Problem understanding is typically, but not necessarily, the first step in a design science research endeavor. Understanding a general problem, present in one or more concrete problem instances, is a basis for understanding how this general problem may be solved.  While exploring a specific problem instance,   it may become clearer what the core of the problem is, and thus focussing the potential solution design to these areas. 

While problem understanding is a basis for the research activity, it is not a pure description of the problem. Under the design science paradigm, problems need to be conceptualized in terms of an envisioned solution. In this activity, researchers take a perspective on the problem at hand, which is colored by their knowledge and experience. 

% Solution design
The outcome of a design science research endeavor is ultimately that \emph{design knowledge} is produced, that is, empirically grounded knowledge about how to design solutions to specific problems. The knowledge is gained while solving the identified problem at hand, and abstracted as general knowledge. 

% Validation
 The primary goal of \emph{validation} is to assess whether the solution proposal is feasible for the problem instance. \emelie{Next sentence is hard to understand, maybe move to validation section?} \per{Somewhat extended:} However, the scope of the design knowledge gained in a study, can be extended by systematically extending the scope of the validation in subsequent studies, thus adding to the knowledge base.

%Design Science as a Lens
We designed a \emph{visual abstract template} to help identifying the design science constructs in software engineering research \cite{StoreyESEM17}, and further extended the template with survey questions, to help analyze software engineering literature from a design science perspective \cite{Engstrom19arxiv} see Figure~\ref{fig:VA-template}. 
%\per{Include the following or not?}\emelie{I think not, (but we should refer to the arxiv paper rather than the ESEM paper above). Instead we could explain the benefits of using it.} We further extended the template with survey questions, the helped analyze software engineering literature from a design science perspective \cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. Based on an analysis of 38 papers, selected as `best papers' from five years of the ICSE conference (2014--2018 inclusive), we conclude that the design science paradigm is not explicitly used as a frame for the research, although the constructs of design science research are present implicitly. 

Our design science template covers the main constructs of design science research: The theoretical contribution in terms of a \emph{technological rule}; its instantiation in terms of a real \emph{problem--solution} pair;  the empirical or theoretical support for the \emph{problem} understanding, the \emph{solution} design. Further, the bottom three boxes address the \emph{relevance} of the research, the \emph{rigor} of the research activities,  and a statement about what makes the technological rule \emph{novel} in relation to the underpinning research, be it with focus on a refined problem conceptualization a new or improved solution design, or a validation of the the technological rule in a new context. 


Design science is a paradigm used in many different research fields, and it is instantiated in many variants.  The above summary reflects what we have found suitable in software engineering, and some of our rationale and alternative instantiations are discussed below.


\subsection{Design Science and Empirical Studies \per{Find better title}}

The formal sciences do not relate to empirical research as their primary goal is to build systems that are internally consistent. The explanatory sciences aim to describe, explain, and possibly predict phenomena in their field of study, and are thus empirical. The design sciences aim to develop knowledge for the design of artifacts or improvement of existing entities, i.e.\ solving \emph{construction problems} or  \emph{improvement problems}, and thus include both empirical and design constituents. 

The Nobel Prize laureate in Economics, Herbert A.\ Simon, used other terms for the distinction between explanatory and design sciences~\cite{Simons69}. Design sciences are referred to as the ``science of the artificial'', in contrast to explanatory science, as the ``science of the natural''. The latter refers not only to natural sciences in the narrow sense, but to other phenomena that seem to appear `naturally'. %In this broader sense, we may find both `natural' and `artificial' phenomena in software engineering, and thus may frame the research in different paradigms, depending on the phenomenon under study. 
\emelie{Not sure this distinction helps, are there any natural laws that we rely on or build on in software engineering?} \per{This distinction helped a lot in conveying the message at my EASE keynote}


As a research paradigm design science contains a set of beliefs regarding both the type and nature of knowledge as well as on how it can be validated. Although none of the design science advocates in the software engineering community would disagree with this claim, design science is often discussed as if it was a specific methodology to be selected among other empirical methods. For example, Wohlin and Aurum acknowledge that design science may be considered a paradigm or a method, and choose to view it as a method in their context \cite{Wohlin2015}.

The philosophical stance behind design science is what is characterized as pragmatism~\cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}%\emelie{it is a philosophical tradition from 1870 not sure what reference to use...}
, referring to a view that all knowledge is approximate and valued by its usefulness for solving practical problems. Hevner \emph{et al.} express this in terms of utility: 

\begin{quote}
	That is the essence of design science. Contribution arises from utility. If the artifact does not solve the problem (search, implementability), it has no utility. If utility is not demonstrated (evaluation), then there is no basis upon which to accept the claims that it provides any contribution (contribution).~\cite[p. 91]{hevner_design_2004}
\end{quote}

%\emelie{Skip this section?}Pragmatists strive to reach consensus over evidence, why access to stakeholders' perceptions are necessary in the validation of design knowledge. Since such stance is less dogmatic than other philosophical stances, our emphasis when framing empirical software engineering as design science, is on the type and nature of the produced knowledge rather than on the methodology applied. Various methods may be used to gain insights into a problem. 

Gregor and Hevner also refer to design science as a paradigm~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}. Johannesson, on the other hand, disagrees with this and argues that design science refers to the objective of changing the world\per{action research?}, in contrast to describing it, and that this is done primarily by creating artefacts not knowledge~\cite{johannesson_introduction_2014}. Our stance is that design science is a paradigm for software engineering research and as researchers our primary goal is to create knowledge to be applied by practitioners in the field. Furthermore, we consider artefacts as embedding design knowledge.

\subsection{Software Engineering Research as Design Science}

%Design Science Studies
In their practitioner article on industry--academia collaboration in software engineering, Carver and Prikladnicki stress the importance of a synergistic relationship between software practitioners and software engineering researchers.
\begin{quote}Practitioners could obtain more relevant research results, and researchers could better understand the type and scope of problems to examine.~\cite{CarverIEEESW2018}
\end{quote} 

These practitioner--researcher synergies resonate well with the design science paradigm, as illustrated in one of their examples, introducing automated bug assignment to handle a large inflow of bug reports \cite{JonssonBug15}. We have used the same example to illustrate our visual abstract \cite{StoreyESEM17}, see Figure \ref{fig:BugAssignment}.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, trim={7mm 30mm 7mm 30mm },clip]{Figures/VATemplateJonsson.pdf}
\caption{Visual abstract for the paper on automated bug assignment \cite{JonssonBug15}.}
\label{fig:BugAssignment}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The automated bug assignment research was not originally presented through the design science lens. However, like much software engineering research it is implicitly conducted as design science research \cite{Engstrom19arxiv}. 
The scientific knowledge gained from the work can be phrased as a \emph{technological rule}:
\begin{quote}{To achieve more effective assignment of bugs to teams in large scale industrial contexts use ensemble-based machine learning to automate bug assignment. \cite{StoreyESEM17}}\end{quote}

The general \emph{problem} on inefficient bug assignment is observed in the literature as well as in the specific industrial contexts, where this research was conducted. With a solution in mind to use machine learning techniques to assign bugs to teams, the characteristics of the defect data and the organizational context were explored, to identify the characteristics of the \emph{problem instance}. Related work on bug classification as well as on machine learning techniques, underpinned the \emph{design decisions} for the proposed solution. The machine learning solutions were implemented in the Weka framework \cite{hall_weka_2009}, and trained and \emph{validated} on real data from five projects across two companies/domains, on 50 000 bug reports. For the specific companies, a design artifact was produced, namely the bug assignment tool built on top of Weka.

The \emph{relevance} of the research is ensured by being anchored in the literature as well as in the specific problem instances of the study. Research \emph{rigor} is ensured by structured and transparent research methods, conducted with real world data. The \emph{novelty} of the research lies in the technological rule, embedding the choice of machine learning classifiers (ensemble-based), validating the ability to demonstrate a system of automated bug assignment which precision is on par with the existing manual procedures.


%Empirical Software Engineering and Design Science
%The \emph{empirical components} of research are different for different research paradigms. The formal sciences are ``empirically void'' as they primarily aim to build internally consistent systems \cite{van_aken_management_2004}. However, both explanatory sciences and design sciences have empirical components. Explanatory sciences observe `natural' phenomena to explain and predict future behavior, while design sciences use empirical methods, both to understand the problem at hand, and to validate the proposed solution and intervention in context. 

In the field of research with organizations as their study objects, van Aken proposed to make a distinction between explanatory and design sciences by dividing the research into two fields: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Organization Theory as description-driven research under the explanatory research paradigm, observing how organizations behave `naturally', and 
\item Management Theory as prescription-driven research under the design sciences paradigm, designing interventions to manage organization~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}.  
\end{itemize}

We do not propose a corresponding distinction for software engineering, but call researchers to awareness of the existence of the different paradigmatic perspectives, and their implications for choice of research methodology and the knowledge building.

Purely observational studies, which aim to characterize the status of a field of software engineering practice, primarily have the characteristic of explanatory sciences as they aim to explore the current, `natural' \emelie{I don't understand the concept of 'natural' state of practice}\per{I tried to explain:} state of practice. This does not refer to `natural' in the sense of natural sciences, as software and its engineering are designed artifacts. However, the phenomena can be studied with respect to properties that are considered emergent from the phenomena, independently of their design variations. Observational studies, which aim to understand a problem, with the purpose of developing or improving an intervention to address the problem, may be viewed as a part of the design sciences paradigm. 
\emelie{I think this definition of problem understanding fit in to the explanatory sciences as well.} \per{I think the distinction is the purpose.}
\emelie{Maybe we should distinguish between problem understanding and problem conceptualisation instead?} 

The empirical contributions under the design sciences include both the problem understanding and the empirical insights from the design of the intervention in its context. Series of studies may be used to extend the scope of the technological rule. The empirical insights may also be extended into design theories, for example following procedures proposed by Sj{\o}berg at al.~\cite{sjoberg2008building}.

\section{Design theory}
\emelie{This section partly repeats and partly contradicts sec 2.2, remove?} In another, similar field of research, van Aken proposes to distinguish \emph{management theory}, that is prescriptive, from \emph{organisational theory}, that is explanatory~\cite{van_aken_management_2005}. We have observed that a similar distinction could be useful when discussing software engineering theory. In this section we elaborate on how to articulate and mature prescriptive software engineering theory that is the product of design science research. 

\subsection{Outputs from design science research}

\emelie{Skip this section? Maybe we confuse people with this list of outcomes more than help (At least it confuses me). The outcomes do not really map to the VA-template nor the DS-model (The constructs and design theories are covered). They are also seem to be specific to information systems (architecture, frameworks, design principles...) and not software engineering (processes, practices, tools...} \per{Agree on removing table, but add examples of outcomes.}. 
\label{sec:outputs}
Outputs from design science research may be of many different kinds. Vaishnavi et al \cite{Vaishnavi} synthesized different kinds of output in information systems, based on \cite{March1995} \cite{gregor_positioning_2013}, as reported in Table~\ref{tab:output}. We have added a tools category, which often embeds design knowledge in software engineering design science studies. 
\begin{table}[t]

\subsection{Technological rules}
\label{sec:technologicalrules}



% outline: The technological rule is the theoretical contribution of design science research also referred to as design knowledge.
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:DS_model}, the technological rule is the theoretical contribution of design science research, also referred to as \emph{design knowledge}. It captures generalized knowledge about mappings between instances of problems and solutions (i.e. in-context validations) and is thus a means to transfer knowledge between contexts. The Technological rule spans both a problem domain and a solution domain and is formulated based on constructs (e.g. conceptual models and taxonomies) in both domains. 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/DS_model.pdf}
% figure caption is below the figure
\caption{Model for design science contributions in software engineering. \cite{engstrom2019}.}
\label{fig:DS_model}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

Gregor and Hevner put forward design theory as the result of generalising from a problem instance to a class of problems and defining the scope of validity of a solution~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}. 
In a technological rule the solution (or intervention) may refer to the use of a specific tool or the application of a more general approach. The scope of validity of the solution is described in terms of a desired effect in a situation.  Also Wieringa discusses design theory, defining it as theories of artefacts in context~\cite{wieringa_design_2009}. The design knowledge within the technological rule aims to help software engineering professionals design customized solutions to their specific problems. Ideally it is a general recommendation based on current state of art including the new additional contribution of a piece of research.

% outline: It can typically be expressed as: 'To achieve <desired effect> in <context> apply <intervention>
Technological rules comprise both the context in terms of the \emph{desired effect} and \emph{the situation} and a prescription in terms of a \emph{proposed intervention}. That way it frames the research product in terms of desired effects and interventions rather than in terms of a solution to a problem. The term \emph{technological rule} originates from Bunge~\cite{bunge_philosophy_1998} and corresponds to `methods' in Gregor and Hevner's work~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}. Our visual abstract template,  see Figure~\ref{fig:VA-template}, emphasizes technological rules as the main takeaway of design science within software engineering research. A technological rule can typically be expressed in the form: 

\begin{center}{\emph{To achieve \textless Effect \textgreater ~ in \textless Situation \textgreater~apply \textless Intervention\textgreater}.} 
\newline
\end{center}

Here, a class of software engineering problems are generalized to a stakeholder's desired effect of applying a potential intervention in a specified situation. 
Making this problem generalization explicit helps the researcher identify and communicate the different value-creating aspects of a research study or program.



% outline: The abstraction level may vary
Wieringa and Daneva address generalisability of design theory~\cite{wieringa_six_2015} and argue that there is no such thing as general design theories. Instead they emphasise the utility of \emph{middle-ranged theory}, defined as theories lacking universal scope. 
Technological rules are examples of such middle-ranged theory that can be expressed at any convenient abstraction level. However, technological rules expressed at a very high abstraction level (e.g. ``To produce software of high quality apply good software engineering practices'') tend to be either trivial or too bold (easy to debunk) while rules at very low abstraction levels have a narrow scope and thus lack relevance for most software engineers. 

One single instance of a problem-solution pair can generate multiple technological rules that are hierarchically related to each other. Similarly there are hierarchical relationships with prior related technological rules to which a specific contribution is compared.
Thus it is important to explicitly formulate the technological rule when presenting design science research and to be consistent with it both when arguing for its relevance and its novelty as well as when presenting the empirical (or analytical) support for the claims.  A research contribution may refine any of the three constituents of an existing rule, add empirical support for the rule as a whole or propose a new rule.

% outline: Technological rules are validated by in-context validations (investigations of instantiations of the rule)
Design knowledge is gained through studying real-world problem-solution pairs. This is done by investigating one or more instances of a solution in context~\cite{wieringa_what_2014}. Van Aken describes the typical design science strategy to be the multiple case study~\cite{van_aken_management_2004}, which could be compared with clinical research alpha- and beta testing, i.e. first case and succeeding cases.
Another way to gain design knowledge (although within one context rather than across contexts) is through action research~\cite{wieringa_technical_2012}. Gregor and Hevner refer to the iterative process of gaining design knowledge as design cycles~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013}. Each instantiation (i.e., a case study or an iteration of action research) constitutes a unit of analysis in relation to that rule and the new knowledge is communicated and assessed from that perspective. 



\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Research Methods in Design Science} 

Design science as a paradigm may embrace a multitude of research methods to be used. For the \emph{problem understanding}\emelie{How to use the terms problem understanding, problem conceptualization, problem characterization?} and \emph{validation} of problem--solution pairs, empirical research methods are used. Methods supporting realism and natural settings~\cite{StolABC18}, are preferred as the problem in its context is in focus for design science research. 

The typical research methodology to study and test technological rules is multiple case studies, according to van Aken \cite{van_aken_management_2004}. In the case studies, a series of problems of the same class is adressed. Design knowledge is built up through the empirical validation of the solution in context. Case study methodology is well established in software engineering \cite{Runeson12Case} and fits thus well into the design science paradigm. Methods for data collection and analysis can be selected from the rich plethora of options available for such studies, for example, interviews, focus groups, observational studies, archival data, and software metrics. Action research is another way of producing and validating technological rules. However action research does not explicitly aim at developing knowledge that can be transferred to other contexts but rather to make a change in one specific local context. Both Wieringa~\cite{wieringa_technical_2012} and Johannesson~\cite{johannesson_introduction_2014} discuss action research as one of several empirical methods that can be used to produce design knowledge.

Gorschek \emph{et al.} defined a ``model for technology transfer in practice'' \cite{GorschekSW2006} focussing on industry--academia collaboration, which has some elements of design science, see Figure \ref{fig:GorschekModel}.

\end{figure}

The model, which prescribes conceptual steps in solving a problem in an industry-academia collaboration setting, has elements of problem identification and formulation. The design of solutions involve studying the literature (state of the art) and selection of a candidate solution. This solution is validated in three steps, in academia, statically, and dynamically, before it is released into operations. 

All these elements fit into the design science lens, although the model (by intention) focuses primarily on the artifact and specific context, rather than the generalized knowledge and technological rule, which are significant element of design science research. Further, when taking the generalization of knowledge and iterative knowledge building is stressed, it becomes clear that industry--academia collaboration is not a one-way transfer of technology, but a mutual interaction between the two.

The example study of automated bug assignment was conducted in several steps, summarized from an industry--academia collaboration point of view, which can be mapped onto the above model \cite{CarverIEEESW2018}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Problem formulation}: Indepth studies of defect reports and their links to other information elements and activities
\item \emph{Study state of the art}: A mapping study was performed of trace-link research, identifying the theoretical foundation \cite{Borg2013EMSE}
\item \emph{Candidate solution}: Development of experimental tools, supporting multiple algorithms
\item \emph{Validation in academia}: Comparison of algorithm performance in academic research \cite{BorgESEM13}
\item \emph{Dynamic validation}: Training and cross-validation of tool on real data sets \cite{JonssonBug15}
\item \emph{Release solution}: Incorporation of a simplified version of the wools in to the company's toolset
\end{itemize} 



\subsection{Problem understanding}


 % Who, What, Where, When, Why and How

% (Who?) Problem understanding is ultimately an act of the practitioner but could be done in collaboration between researchers and practitioners or by researchers alone

In the long run, software engineering theory aims at helping practitioners designing solutions to their specific problem. Thus problem understanding is ideally an act of a software engineering practitioner and not a researcher. However, to produce such theory research is needed. In the previous section we described how design knowledge is obtained and mature through observations of real life instances of problem-solution pairs. For each such instance the problem needs to be formulated (understood) according to a conceptual lens. Such problem understanding can take place in collaboration between practitioners and researchers in, for example, action research or case study research, or by researchers observing software engineering practice.

% (What?) The outcome of the problem understanding step is a conceptualuzation of the problem instance towards an envisioned solution and thus tightly connected to a specific design approach

The outcome of the problem understanding activities is a conceptuptalization of the problem instance towards an envisioned solution. If for example the proposed solution is to design a visualisation system, the problem should typically be described in terms of a group of target users, their questions and tasks, and their measurements or data~\cite{meyer_nested_2015}. Thus the problem formulation is tightly connected to the solution design and cannot be done in isolation. Although we consider much of the software engineering research to be design science research, not all exploratory and descriptive research provide relevant design knowledge in all cases.

\per{Add here? A behavioral scientist would make a different problem description of a software project, compared to a software engineering researcher, and different software engineering researchers are influence by their background as well. This implies that the problem understanding is intertwined with the solution design.
}

% (What?) The research contribution is not the conceptualisation, but the identification of the problem instance (empirical support for prevalence of a conceptual problem) and potential updates of the modelling approach (new aspects of the technological rule)

Furthermore, the research contribution is \emph{not} the conceptualisation as such since this is connected to the instance of the problem and not the class of problems. Instead the research contribution is the empirical support for new, existing or refined technological rules. A research contribution from the problem understanding step could for example be the identification of problem instances -- confirming the prevalence of a general problem -- or updates of the conceptualisation approach -- i.e. the design constructs of a general solution.

% (When?) Problem understanding is the first step towards a solution design.

Problem understanding is the first step towards a solution design. However, depending on the type of the solution, problem understanding may need to be repeated at several abstraction levels starting with the stakeholder's problem description and for example in case of a tool implementation reaching to the level of implementation details (such as  choice of algorithm). If this is the case different types of technological rules are used and validated at different abstraction levels. It is important to be aware of which these rules are and ensure that the validation of a solution takes place at all these levels and that the validations are mapped to the correct technological rules. 

% (Where?) Problem understanding must originate in empirical observations of practice
Software engineering is a discipline, in which conditions are rapidly changing. To provide relevant recommendations -- technological rules -- problem understanding must originate in empirical observations of practice -- i.e. real life problem instances. Furthermore, software engineering is a socio-technical endeavor implying that stakeholders need to be involved in both problem understanding and solution validation at least for technological rules at the higher abstraction levels. Lower level technological rules may be investigated in isolation but must be related to the higher level rules to be of relevance. 

% (How?) Problem understanding should build on prior work

Ideally problem understanding can be guided by theory -- i.e. prior technological rules and conceptualisation approaches. 



\per{A solution searching the problem?}

\per{Problems are described as improvement problems and/or construction problems, wicked problems, socio-technical, involving stakeholders.} 



\subsection{Solution design}


%Solution design is one out of three knowledgecreating activities in the software engineering design cycle
Design science comprises both creation and validation of design knowledge, i.e. prescriptive and context dependant knowledge. Such knowledge can be achieved by investigating real world instances of problem-solution pairs. We have identified three different knowledge creating activities of which the \emph{solution design} is one. The other two are the \emph{problem understanding} and the \emph{empirical validation} of the solution to the problem in context, see Figure~\ref{fig:VA-template}


%Ultimately an act of a SE practitioner
Just like problem understanding, the actual design of a real-life solution is the act of the practitioner, preferably guided by design knowledge produced by researchers. %Building on previous work/technological rule
Guided by existing technological rules, see Section~\ref{sec:technologicalrules}, and other research outputs, see Section~\ref{sec:outputs} a practitioner should be able to identify and adopt possible solutions to their context. However, one activity to produce design knowledge is to work through increments of a solution design either together with practitioners in a real-life setting or off-line. %Creative process/alternative solutions should be considered/design decisions reported
While the solution design is a creative activity, the design knowledge it produces can be made more accessible and trustworthy if critical design decisions are clearly reported together with considerations about alternative solutions.



%May include several levels of design/evaluation and validation 


%Reflections on the design process less important in the SE domain than in the IS domain
Wieringa describes design science as an act of producing knowledge by designing useful things~\cite{wieringa_design_2009} and makes a distinction between knowledge problems and practical problems. Similarily, Gregor and Hevner emphasise the dual focus on the artefact and its design~\cite{gregor_positioning_2013} in information systems, and argues for an iterative design process where validation of the artefact provides feedback information to improve both the design process and the artefact. Although such an approach may be relevant for designing software engineering artefacts too, there is an important difference between the two research domains: while information systems refers to a solution domain, software engineering research originates in a problem domain with a plethora of more or less sophisticated solutions, not necessarily artefacts. Thus the empirical contribution to problem understanding is of higher importance in the software engineering context while the reflection on the design as such is of less value compared to research contributions in a typical solution domain such as information systems. Still, in both cases it is design knowledge that is produced as the aim is to produce prescriptive knowledge for practitioners in their respective domain. 

 

\subsection{Validation \per{and generalization?}}
\outline{
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem--solution pair \emph{in context}
\item Widening scope by widening validation context. 
\item theoretical/analytical generalization rather than statistical 
\item All kinds of empirical studies \cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}\cite{Runeson12Case,WohlinExpBook12}
\item Refer to ABC \cite{StolABC18} for strategic choise of method vs validation goal 
\item Easterbrook \cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}
\end{itemize}
}

Validation of research under the design science paradigm is always about a problem--solution pair in \emph{context}. The technological rule specifies implicitly the validation activities; the intervention is the object of study, the situation defines the context, and the expected effect defines the validation criteria. This points to the `in vivo' software engineering context as the ultimate validation context for design science research. Several authors consequently propose multiple case studies as the natural research strategy in design science \cite{van_aken_management_2004}\per{add more}. However, practical limitations can prevent the research endeavor from taking place in real, operational environments. 

The risks related to validating interventions in business critical contexts may be high. If the intervention does not deliver the effect as expected, the outcome of the software engineering activity as a whole may be endangered. Further, the costs related to implementing the intervention may also be high -- for example changing a work flow or adapting the information infrastructure to a new tool. Thus, validation procedures may be used, which gradually extend the evaluation scope for the intervention.

On the other hand, reducing the scope and complexity of the evaluation context too much may take away the realism which is essential for addressing a relevant problem with a feasible solution. `In vitro' studies may be useful to validate specific mechanisms, but they are not feasible for complex systems studies.  

Stol and Fitzgerald adapted Runkel and McGrath's framework for research strategies, to guide balancing generalizability, precision and realism in designing validation studies \cite{StolABC18}. This framework may be useful in choosing research strategies in relation to the goals of the research endeavor. The framework defines two dimensions of i) universality/specificity of context and systems, and ii) level of obtrusiveness. Maximum potential realism is achieved with specific contexts and systems, and more or less obtrusive research, depending on the perspective of explanatory research (field study) or design science (field experiments). \per{Expand to explain more or remove?} 

The specific choice of methods for the validation depends on the research question. Easterbrook \emph{et al.} provide guidance to the selection of methods and conclude for the philosophical stand behind design science: ``Pragmatists use any available methods, and strongly prefer mixed methods research, where several methods are used to shed light on the issue under study'' \cite{easterbrook_selecting_2008}.

The design science paradigm builds primarily on theoretical/analytical generalization, in contrast to explanatory sciences, which rely more on statistical generalization \cite[p. 30]{Runeson12Case}. Extending the scope of validity for a technological rule is done by applying the intervention to new contexts or by reasoning about the validity to another context, by comparing key characteristics of the contexts. This is referred to as case-based generalization \cite{Wieringa2015}. 


\section{Using the Design Science Frame in Software Engineering}
We suggest three direct uses of the design science paradigm as a frame for software engineering research. Firstly, it can help in assessing contributions in research, both for the research community and during the planning and design of a research project (Section \ref{sec:assessment}). Secondly, design science, particularly the technological rule, can be used in knowledge building, synthesizing and advancing the theoretical knowledge in the software engineering field (Section \ref{sec:knowledge}). Thirdly, the design science frame may help in communicating research across the community and with industry (Section \ref{sec:communication}).

\subsection{Assessment of contributions}
\label{sec:assessment}

\peggy{not sure you will like that I associate relevance, rigor and novelty with proactive, prospective and retrospective phases here... feel free to delete if you don't like it}
Assessment of research contributions can be conducted proactively (when relevance may be a primary concern for consideration before the research is executed), prospectively (as the research is ongoing and when rigor should be carefully considered). or retrospectively (where novelty of the design knowledge produced may become more evident).
Below, we discuss assessments of contributions and refer to a concrete example of a research study by Shi \emph{et al.}~\cite{Shi2017} that we frame using the design science lens, see Figure~\ref{fig:VA-example}.

%\paragraph{Validation should be made in context and test the impact of the solution on the real problem}

\subsubsection{Relevance of a design science study is described in terms of problem similarity and solution applicability.} 

The relevance of a research contribution could be viewed from two perspectives: from the perspective of other practitioners that may benefit from the design knowledge produced and from the perspective of the research community. 

From an individual practitioner's point of view, the relevance of a research contribution may be assessed by comparing their specific context with the study context described in the research report. 
A practitioner may need to consider their specific context may allow the design knowledge to applied as is, or if it should be customized in some way, or perhaps the knowledge may not apply at all to their situation or problem.
In the example by Shi \emph{et al.}, (see Fig.~\ref{fig:VA-example}) a practitioner may similarly face the challenge of testing very larger systems and  that they too could benefit from using historical build information and test dependencies to guide which tests should be run (or not).

From the research community perspective, relevance is often considered in terms of how common the studied problem is and how generalizable the produced design knowledge may be. To enable both types of assessments, relevant context factors need to be reported. Not all context factors are helpful in making this assessment but only those that are critical for either the applicability of the solution or for the potential gain of applying the solution. 
Referring to the example by Shi \emph{et al.}, reducing wasteful test executions is a frequent topic of research in software engineering and builds on much evidence that this problem is also relevant in practice.

\subsubsection{Rigor of a design science study refers to the strength of the added support for the technological rule.} Rigor may be assessed in all of the three knowledge creating activities (problem understanding, design and solution validation). 
Rigor should be considered when the research project is designed, as well as throughout the project and afterwards to reflect on possible threats to validity. 
It is worth noting that the solution design activity is by nature a creative process and does not necessarily have to add to the rigor of the research overall. One aspect of rigor in the design activity could be the extent to which a solution is built on prior design knowledge, and in such cases consideration of alternative solutions can be taken in to account. 
Alternative, rigor in the problem understanding phase (which is the case of the research by Shi \emph{et al.}) can be used to guide a solution design which is what happened in the case of the research by Shi \emph{et al.} as their mathematical formulation of wasteful test executions guided them towards the solution to consider test movements based on historical build information and actual dependencies of tests. 

The other two activities, i.e. problem understanding and solution validation, are on the other hand based on common empirical methods on which relevant validity criteria can be applied. For example, the study by Shi \emph{et al.} can be considered high in rigor as the proposed solution is validated by its application to 5 large software systems.  Furthermore, they found that developers accepted 84\% of the recommendations made by their proposed intervention (the TestOptimizer tool). 

\subsubsection{Novelty of a design science study is expressed in terms of new or refined technological rules.} Technological rules may be expressed at several abstraction levels, thus it is always possible to identify an abstraction level at which a research contribution is novel, may it be at the cost of general relevance.  In the research by Shi \emph{et al.}, novelty of the intervention proposed in the technological rule is rather easy to assess, as the TestOptimizer tool (and the techniques it embodies) is a novel contribution.  
However, novelty may not always be a priority in a given research effort.
To optimize rigor, novelty and relevance of reported research, the researchers should strive to express the technological rule at the highest possible abstraction level, at which it is novel, the provided evidence give strong support and are not debunked by previous studies (or common sense). However, adding empirical support for existing, but under-validated, technological rules have a value of its own, which makes novelty less important than the rigor and relevance criteria.


\subsection{Knowledge building}
\label{sec:knowledge}

Articulating the knowledge that is produced by our research in a more uniform way may help in building and synthesizing related knowledge in our community. 
The technological rules that emerge can at best be considered as theory fragments that prescribe and predict how a certain intervention for a particular context will lead to a proposed change. 
But our hope is that linking technological rules that are related (perhaps in hierarchical form) may over time help our community arrive at theories that may be more general, and that can be refined and improved over time. 
For example, Shi \emph{et al.}'s research on reducing wasteful text executions can be related to other test minimization technological rules which together may be more generalizable.

\subsection{Research communication}
\label{sec:communication}

As we discussed above, building design knowledge in software engineering requires a close partnership and relies on tight collaborations with practitioners. 
Practitioners play a participatory role in our research by confirming and eliciting problems to be solved, as well as by designing practical solutions using design knowledge, and then validating them in context (on real problem instances). 
Consequently, how we communicate our research to practitioners is critical to this participatory research approach. 
We feel the technological rules will be valuable in communicating our findings to industry and that the visual abstract may also appeal to some practitioners wanting to quickly gain a bigger picture of the research that is behind the design knowledge embodied by the technological rule. 
We are currently in the process of getting feedback from industry partners.  For example, see \url{http://dsse.org} for a collection of visual abstracts we authored based on the distinguished papers from ICSE from 2014 to 2018.
